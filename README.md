# McGlynn MyMas Crew

The goal of this project is to learn how to go from “Prompts to Production,” in building a Multi-Agent system (MAS) for Product Feature Comparison. 
This collaborative multi-agent system is designed to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions by systematically gathering, analyzing, and presenting comprehensive product feature comparisons across multiple brands and companies.

## Agents
Each agent is set up to accomplish one or more tasks; agents collaborate with each other.  The process starts effectively using better prompts with various AI assistants (Claude.ai, etc.)  and using their output to help create a project plan, do research, create code, and help with troubleshooting problems.  There are final output deliverables, including a report and various charts of comparative data as a result of the agent collaborations. 

## User Input
In this MAS, the user is prompted for three types of input:  "Product_Category.” "Target_Brands,” and “Needs Features.”  Any relevant input can be used, depending upon the users’ desires.

For example:  
“Product Category”: Noise-canceling headphones

“Target Brands”: Sony, Bose, Apple, Beats

“Needs Features”: High-quality sound, long battery life, comfortable for extended wear, good noise cancellation, suitable for professional and personal use

## Technical Overview
This project involved using various processes and tools (Anaconda navigator, Pythlon, Visual Studio, GitHub and more) along with the Crewai framework. Three agents are set up to Analyze, Research, and Summarize the results. Review the code and see if you have any questions.
